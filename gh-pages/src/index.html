    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>CampusnNetSync makes sure you can access all course files on CampusNet in a folder on your computer. It is like Dropbox for CampusNet!</p>
    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>First log in with your campusnet credentials.</li>
      <li>Next create a folder to sync to.</li>
      <li>Then when you need a file just press the big red button. It will open the folder and fetch the latest changes on CampusNet. Thatâ€™s it!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Does it work on windows?</h2>
    <p>Yes, it works on both Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
    <a class="btn js-download" href="https://github.com/tmpethick/campusnet-electron/releases/latest">Get it!</a>

  <h2 class="section-title">More questions...</h2>
  <h2>Should I set a sync interval?</h2>  
  <p>You actually don't have to. If you navigate to your CampusNet folder by clicking the red button in the app the files will be synced. In fact <i>I recommend not syncing</i> since there is no point in getting the files before you need them.</p>
  <h2>How was it built?</h2>
  <p>It was built with <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">electron</a> which combines node and chromium to allow for development of desktop applications with web technologies. This is also why it works for both Windows and Mac OS X.</p>
  <p>You can check out the source on <a href="https://github.com/tmpethick/campusnet-electron">github</a>!</p>
  <h2>Why build it?</h2>
  <p>I mainly build it because it quickly became a mess using CampusNet with multiple versions in my download folder. It was also to experiment with desktop development with <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">electron</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a>.</p>
  <h2>What about linux?</h2>
  <p>Luckily it should be fairly easy to add since it is built with electron. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tmpethick/campusnet-electron">fork</a> it and send a PR!</p>
